## About me
I'm a Software Engineer & Full-Stack Web Developer. Almost all my personal projects are centered around automating tedious and repetitive tasks. I love home labs and also own my own home server! I'm geared more towards web-based projects but I'm still digging into projects that include mobile and low-level systems coded in languages such as Rust, C++, and Java.

  <summary><h3>Roomi's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  My passion for computers in general existed for as long as I remember, I used to tinker a lot with my Windows 7 operating system at the time including upgrading it to newer     versions and upgrading it for more performance. That passion extended to my phone too, as I was fed up with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and installed a custom ROM on it at the age of 14. I started my road to programming when I was 16, I had taken and finished a course in Python by 17. My projects were simplistic and involved reading and manipulating files with python. Attending AUIS as a Software Engineer major was my first real contact with programming as I started learning more and more about Java. Now, I had strayed from Java and focused more on the Web, utilizing JavaScript and its relevant frameworks to create automated solutions for myself and professionally. My current interest lies in Low-Level Software Systems, and navigating this domain with Rust and C++.
