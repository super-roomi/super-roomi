- 👋 Hi, I’m @super-roomi
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development, which isn't viable at the moment since I need to get a "real" job 💀
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ASP.NET with C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are mainly C#-built and relevant to the .NET Framework overall, though I'm open to discovering new tech
- 📫 To reach me, you can contact me through @roomiisdead on instagram or roomiisdead@gmail.com through email
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have the cutest bird who wakes up every morning and chooses to abuse me
